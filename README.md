# Nearest Earth Objects Hazard Prediction
This project predicts whether a near-Earth object (NEO) is hazardous or not based on various attributes such as absolute magnitude, estimated diameter, relative velocity, and miss distance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "NASA Nearest Earth Objects (1910-2024)" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about near-Earth objects, including their hazard status.
